    "bot": "To complete this practical exam, you'll need to create several files in NetBeans IDE. Here's a breakdown of what each file should contain:\n\n1. **Student.java**: This file will hold the definition of the `Student` class, which has two attributes: `student_id` and `student_name`. The code for this file might look something like this:\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    private int studentId;\n    private String studentName;\n\n    public Student(int id, String name) {\n        studentId = id;\n        studentName = name;\n    }\n\n    // Getters and setters for student_id and student_name attributes\n}\n```\n2. **StudentRepository.java**: This file will contain the `StudentRepository` class, which manages a list of `Student` objects. You'll need to implement methods for adding students, removing students, and retrieving students from the repository.\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class StudentRepository {\n    private List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    public void addStudent(Student student) {\n        students.add(student);\n    }\n\n    public void removeStudent(int id) {\n        for (Student student : students) {\n            if (student.getStudentId() == id) {\n                students.remove(student);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public List<Student> getStudents() {\n        return students;\n    }\n}\n```\n3. **StudentIterator.java**: This file will contain the `StudentIterator` class, which implements the iterator design pattern to traverse the list of `Student` objects.\n```java\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class StudentIterator implements Iterator<Student> {\n    private List<Student> students;\n    private int index = 0;\n\n    public StudentIterator(List<Student> students) {\n        this.students = students;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean hasNext() {\n        return index < students.size();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Student next() {\n        if (hasNext()) {\n            return students.get(index++);\n        } else {\n            throw new NoSuchElementException(\"No more elements\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void remove() {\n        // Implement the remove operation for the iterator\n    }\n}\n```\n4. **StudentIteratorInterface.java**: This file will contain the `StudentIterator` interface, which defines the contract for the iterator to traverse the list of `Student` objects.\n```java\npublic interface StudentIterator extends Iterator<Student> {\n    // No methods needed in this interface\n}\n```\n5. **Main.java** (renamed from `<your name>.java`): This file will contain the main class that uses the `StudentRepository` and `StudentIterator` classes to display student information.\n\nWhen you've completed these files, make sure to compile and run the program using NetBeans IDE. The output should be a list of student IDs and names."
