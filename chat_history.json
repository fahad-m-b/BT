However, I can tell you that both the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord are known for their efficiency and reliability rather than outright speed. If you're interested in the top speed, it would be best to look up the exact models you're considering. For a thrilling driving experience, consider checking out sports or hybrid versions of these cars. Enjoy your car shopping!"
